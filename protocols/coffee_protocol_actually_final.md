# Coffee Protocol - ACTUALLY FINAL VERSION

## Ingredients
- Coffee beans (medium roast, freshly ground)
- Water (filtered, 205째F)
- French press (cleaned!)

## Steps
1. Grind 30g coffee to medium-coarse (setting 15 on our grinder)
2. Heat 450ml water to 205째F 
3. **Rinse press with hot water first** (important!)
4. Add coffee to press
5. Pour water slowly in circular motion
6. Stir gently **TWICE** (not once)
7. Wait exactly 4 minutes (use timer!)
8. Press plunger down slowly and steadily
9. Serve immediately into warmed cups

## Notes
- 1:15 ratio is perfect
- Don't let it sit after pressing or it gets bitter
- Grind size is crucial - too fine = over-extraction
- 205째F extracts better flavor than 200째F
- Pre-warming the press makes a difference
- Stirring twice ensures even extraction

## Equipment Notes
- Burr grinder preferred over blade
- Digital scale essential for consistency
- Clean the press after every use
- Replace filter screen every 6 months

## Troubleshooting
- **Too bitter:** grind coarser or reduce time
- **Too weak:** grind finer or increase time
- **Too sour:** increase temperature or time

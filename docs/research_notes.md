# Coffee Research Notes

## Daily Log

### July 10
Started testing different temperatures. 195째F way too cool.

### July 11
200째F better but still not right. Coffee tastes flat.

### July 12
**205째F is the sweet spot!** Much better extraction.

### July 13
Tried more coffee (32g) but it was too strong. Stick with 30g.

### July 14
Experimented with longer brewing time (4.5 min) but it got bitter. 4 minutes is right.

### July 15
**BREAKTHROUGH!** Found the perfect recipe:
- 30g coffee
- 450ml water at 205째F
- 4 minutes exactly
- Grinder setting 15
- Rating: 9/10

Need to test this again tomorrow to confirm consistency.

## Equipment Notes
- Clean grinder every week
- Buy beans from local roaster (fresher)
- Water quality matters - use filtered
- Pre-heat the press with hot water

## Next Experiments
- [ ] Try different bean origins
- [ ] Test cold brew method
- [ ] Experiment with pour-over
- [ ] Compare ceramic vs glass press

## Questions
- Does grind consistency affect extraction?
- Should we try single-origin vs blends?
- What about different roast levels?
